## 📚 Description

### 📅 Time & Date Block

- Start Date: October 22, 2025 (Tuesday Evening Warm-Up)
- Expected Finish: October 31, 2025
- Checkpoint Code: CP003
- GitHub Folder: CP003_Functions_ErrorHandling_ArrearU1

### 📝 What’s Covered in CP003?

This checkpoint is the 3rd step in my Developer Journey, where I focus on three tightly linked skills:

1. *Python Functions* – Defining, calling, arguments, return values, scope, recursion.
2. *Error Handling* – Try-except blocks, built-in exceptions, user-defined exceptions.
3. *Arrear Syllabus (Unit 1)* – Focus on Structural Analysis 2 – Unit 1 theory.

All three areas will be blended using short Python examples, handwritten notes, and one mini proof project that reflects the skillset clearly.

This CP003 is not just about learning — it is about starting to speak in functions, handling bugs like a calm developer, and respecting arrear topics by integrating them into code.

---

## 3. 🧪 Practice Plan

This checkpoint will include the following types of Python practice:

1. *Function Design* – Writing basic to advanced functions using parameters and return types.
2. *Error Handling Practice* – Handling common errors using try, except, else, and finally.
3. *Recursion Exercises* – Factorial, Fibonacci, and a custom recursive task.
4. *Arrear Integration Code* – One function or script inspired from Structural Analysis 2 – Unit 1.

We’ll also include:
- 🧠 3 logic-based problem-solving questions.
- 🪲 2 error-handling debugging tasks.
- 🎯 1 mini function-based challenge with real-life twist.

All codes will be stored inside a subfolder: `/Practice/CP003

## 4. 📂 Folder Plan

The following folders and files will be added to the CP003 GitHub repository:

📁 /Practice/CP003_Functions
- basic_functions.py – Basic examples with parameters and return types.
- recursion_tasks.py – Recursive logic for small problems.
- error_handling.py – Try-except, user-defined exception handling.

📁 /Notes/CP003_Handwritten
- Uploaded images or PDFs of handwritten notes (Function flow, error types, recursion trace)

📁 /MiniProject_CP003
- One small function-based utility inspired by arrear topic (Structural Analysis)

📄 README.md
- This documentation file you're currently viewing!

## 5. 📘 Arrear Study Link

📝 Arrear Subject: Structural Analysis – 2  
📘 Focus: *Unit 1 – Arches, 3-Hinged Arches, and Basics of Influence Lines*

🔗 Blend Method:
We’ll integrate arrear topics into Python practice through:
- A short note or diagram summary of Unit 1
- A mini function that simulates arch force calculation or classification logic
- Code comments that explain how the arrear concept inspired the logic

🪄 Goal:
Instead of studying arrears and Python separately, we are turning theory into action — writing code that reflects understanding. This keeps the arrear topic alive in our hands and not just in memory.

## 6. 🧭 Proof Strategy

To show this checkpoint is fully completed, we’ll submit:

1. 🧪 4 Python scripts:
   - Functions (basic to advanced)
   - Error handling tasks
   - Recursion samples
   - Arrear concept-based function

2. 📂 Folder /Practice/CP003 with all .py files inside

3. 📝 Optional handwritten note (PDF or image) explaining:
   - Arrear Unit 1 concept
   - How it blends into our function logic

4. 📜 This README.md will act as a live report for any visitor, mentor, or future hiring manager reviewing our learning story.

## 7. 💬 ReadMe Tone

This repo is part of my self-built Checkpoint Proof System — a journey I started not to impress, but to improve. I’m learning Python step-by-step while blending in subjects from my B.E Civil Engineering backlog, as a way to truly connect knowledge with purpose.

In this checkpoint, I learned not just how functions work — but how they speak. How errors teach us patience. And how one arrear subject can become a tool for deeper thinking.

If you’re a visitor reading this, thank you for witnessing a part of my journey. I hope this inspires you to build your own — even if you start small.
